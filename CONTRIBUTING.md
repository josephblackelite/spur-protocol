# Contributing

## Commit conventions

- Use Conventional Commits for all commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `refactor:`).
- Do not reference tools or vendors in commit messages or pull request text.

## Quality gates

- All changes must pass CI before merge.
- Keep changes reviewable and scoped.

## Documentation requirements

- Documentation must use the canonical terminology contract:
  - Task Envelope (SpurEnvelope)
  - Skill Pack (SkillPack)
  - Governance Policy (GovernancePolicy)
  - Execution Plan (ExecutionPlan)
- Workflow sentence:
  - Task Envelope + Skill Pack + Governance Policy -> Execution Plan -> Fleet Runtime
