**#Spur Protocol**

Spur Protocol is an open standard for defining, governing, and distributing reusable robotics Skill Packs.

It provides a deterministic execution contract between skill authors, fleet operators, and autonomous systems.

By separating intent, skill logic, and governance policy, Spur enables:

**Vendor-agnostic compilation

Fleet-level deployment

Deterministic task validation

Auditability and compliance

Portable skill distribution**

Spur Protocol is designed for both industrial robotics fleets and personal autonomous systems.
